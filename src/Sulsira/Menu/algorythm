    //we want to pull all the pages and the different domains
    //    we want to know if the person is logged in
    // we make the persons details globally accessable
    // if logged in we want to take the persons security level and take the persons domain

    // if the person have no security level and have no domain, then we check for usergroup

    // if the person have none of them then we logout the user and delete his account

    //    but if the person have only a security level we pull only his dashboard

    // if the person has only domain no security level we put only the pages of security level 8 for him
// then check if the person have an access key
    // if yes we pull the access key class to access key stuff
// we pull in the menu depending on his domain and make it globally accessable array
// now we filter by security level: that is we create two arrays one for all the pages he can assess and the other controller restrictions

//          security shoudl be compare and we take only his security level and less

// generate a new array cleaned pages he can access

// the special cases

//    we check to see if the user domain menu have system

//    if yes we we call the system method

//    goes to the menu config and all from teh array the systems the user can access


// then add them to the clean array as drop downs

// the we call the dropdown creator




// menu ui

//    from the cleaned array we loop through pages and check if they are single or dropdown

//    we call the single page method to create bootstrap list

// we call dropdop dowm method as well
